# Juniper-SRX650-Fios-IPv6-PD
The working configuration on a SRX650 for a Fios IPV6 deployment with IPv4 and IPv6 working

Please leave notes on any errors or questions regarding configuration changes. Not much exists on this older product with a PD deployment. 
My DNS access pool for DNS is still not working as expected, waiting a peer review to confirm any changes to resovle Ipv6 DNS. By using Google and OpenDNS all AAAA records are offered.
